# KataBankOCR â€” A Scala implementation of the Code Kata Bank OCR #

See [here](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR) for a description of this project.

## Build & run ##

The Main method is empty.  All of the interesting stuff happens in the unit test suite.  This is just code written for practice and no one would ever want to use it for anything directly so I didn't implement any of the file I/O for reading in the account lists and generating the reports.  

```sh
$ cd KataBankOCR
$ ./sbt
> test
```
